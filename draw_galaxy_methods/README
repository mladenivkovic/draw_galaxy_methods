Intended order of operations:

- first crop and resize image using imagemagick
    e.g. convert input.jpg -resize 1000 x 1000 output.jpg

- set which image you want to use by writing the filename into the `source_image_to_use` file

- run `average_image_down.py`

- run `upscale_reduced.py` to get big image that looks pixelated

- run `make_density_field.py` to make it look like simulation

- run `make_uniform_grid.py` to get image that looks like it has cells


average_image_down.py : reduce image to some lower number of pixels by taking averages

tools.py: misc tools that several scripts use

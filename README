Intended order of operations:

- first crop and resize the image you want to use using imagemagick
    e.g. convert input.jpg -resize 2000 x 2000 output.jpg

- set which image you want to use by writing the filename into the `source_image_to_use` file.
  From the imagemagick example above, that would be 'output.jpg'

- run `average_image_down.py`
    reduces image to some lower number of pixels by taking averages.

- run `upscale_reduced.py` to get big image that looks pixelated

- run `make_density_field.py` to make it look like simulation.

- run `make_uniform_grid.py` to get image that looks like it has cells
  on an uniform grid.

- run `make_uniform_grid.py` to get image that looks like it has cells
  on an uniform grid.

- run `make_amr.py` to get image looking like an AMR grid. You might
  need to tweak the refinement threshold in the script.
